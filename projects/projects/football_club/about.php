		<h5 class="font-weight-bold text-primary"><u>The history of YoungStar soccer Team</u></h5><br><br>

		<p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">YoungStar soccer team has its roots in Nyekete village. The young village boys got interested in soccer. As such, they started forming some teams and making plastic balls to play. Once they head that they could be given the actual balls for soccer if they request. They requested for balls from the MPs in the constituency. Fortunately, they got the balls. From there the team grew up and most people became so interested in soccer.<br><br>

		It was very fortunate that there was and still is a school ground at Gezi Primary school. This ground became the home ground for YoungStar soccer team. As the team grew up, it gained support from the local communities. As such, it gained popularity and got joined in the Mrehwa league. From there, it started to play against the giants in the league.  

		During those days, it had no coach. The players would organize themselves. As time goes by a certain teacher named <a href="contact.php"><b><span><u>Mr Mahoko</u></span></b></a> became so interested and joined the team. For he was already a school coach of soccer team at Gezi Primary school and eventually, he became the coach of the YoungStars soccer team.<br><br> 

		Now the team has grown up and it is in division-one. Please if you got a talent just get <a href="index.php"><b><span><u>registered</u></span></b></a>. We are based in Mrehawa in Nyekete Village. The coach stays at Gezi Primary School and if manage to pass by the school you can see him and get helped as soon as possible if you are so interested in playing soccer as an individual.<br><br>
