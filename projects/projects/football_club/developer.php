				<h4 class="text-success"> About Me</h4>
				<p class="text-danger text-justify"> Hello!! Am Tanaka Chimhande and am a male person. Am the captain of YoungStar Soccer Team. l really love soccer and l think am talented as well. The most position l play very well and feel comfortable with is left-back, that is,  number-3 authentically speaking. People have even nicknamed me as an unbreakable-wall for l really defend the team very well, in fact, wholeheartedly prevent the entire team from defeat.<br><br>


				Surprisingly, l fell in love with computers. I had unquenchable thirst for learning how computers work. Fortunately, l got exposed to the world of computers. As such, I then delved deeper into learning some programing languages. l first learned <b><span>Python</span></b> and l get interested in web development. From there l learned web development languages. These may entail the following<b><span>HTML</span></b>, <b><span>CSS</span></b>, and <b><span>JAVASCRIPT</span></b>. These are the front-end languages.<br><br>

				As time goes by l decided to learn some back-end languages such that will be able to develope full websites and web applications. These languages may implicate the following <b><span>PhP</span></b>and <b><span>MySQL</span></b>. Am looking forward into learnig <b><span>React.JS</span></b> and <b><span>Django</span></b>(Python framework).These are scripting languages in order to interact with the web server and the databse.So, if you want a personal or business website  l can develope it for you. Just contact me on <b><u>(+263778186399)</u></b><br><br>

				Now am a full-stack web developer and really passionated about coding. Most of my time l spend coding. However, am persuing a career in Archaeology and Heritage management at the University of Zimbabwe (Second Year now).<br><hr>
