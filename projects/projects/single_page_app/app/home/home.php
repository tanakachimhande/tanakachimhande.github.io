                <h3>What is Coding/programming?</h3><br>
                 <h5>Coding</h5><br>
                <p>It is of much significance to first understand the term ‘code’ itself. Code is a word used to describe a text written using a certain way (Syntax) of a particular programming language. Programming languages include the following for example:</p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Php</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ol><br>
 
          
                <p>Therefore, coding is the act of writing(creating) that code/s translating human-language into machine(binary) language that a computer understands.</p><br>

                <h5>Programming</h5><br>
                <p>Is about making a computer do what you want it to do. A computer program is just a series of instructions that tell computers what to do or how to perform a certain task.</p><br>

                <h5>Coding vs programming</p><br>
                <p>Coding is the part of programming, but it only focuses on converting the language we understand into binary commands for machine. Programming is the process general process of creating a program that follows certain standards and performs a certain task.</p>
