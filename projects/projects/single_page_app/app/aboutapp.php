All the technologies being produced each passing day are aimed at solving real world problems humans face.As such, humans must be inovative so that they can be inovative which leads to live a better life.This indeed benefits both the present and the next generation.Therefore, this app has been created to solve problems am facing as an individual in learning how to code.<br><br>

                    Learning how to code is crucial for it teaches you problem solving skills which is fantastic in this world. However, it requires dedication and precise methodology.To survive  in this world, one must be able to solve problems in life.So, l decided to learn how to code and l really enjoy it.However, there is a problem here. I usually forget the concepts l have learned when trying to build something. The main reason being that there is no where am recording every crucial programming concept.This obviously leads to confusion and forgetfullness which is bad when it comes to coding so to speak.<br><br>

                    Due to this reason l have decided to crreate an application that will help me record and conserve all the tricks l have learned in any programming language. This will assist me in times when l get stuck, thus speeding up work.This app is not only going to record the concepts but as well the progress. As a newbie in the world of Web development, l have to keep track of my journey for this will motivate me to continue as l want.
